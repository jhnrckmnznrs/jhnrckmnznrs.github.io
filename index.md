Hey there! My name is John Rick Manzanares. I have been called John Rick, John Wick, John, Rick, and many others but I prefer the name 'John Rick'. I am a Filipino residing in <a href="https://philippines.travel/destinations/baguio-city"> Baguio City</a>, hailed as the Summer Capital of the Philippines and the City of Pines, located in the Central Cordillera of Northern Luzon. I finished high school at the <a href = "https://carc.pshs.edu.ph"> Philippine Science High School - Cordillera Administrative Region Campus</a>. Later on, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (2018) and Master of Science in Mathematics (2022) degrees at the <a href = "https://www.upb.edu.ph"> University of the Philippines Baguio</a>.

## MATHEMATICAL JOURNEY
~~~
<div align="justify">
Throughout my studies, I consider differential geometry as the one area of interest that got away. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) caught my attention upon starting my master's thesis. 
<br><br>
Some of my friends, including <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>, and <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, helped me to overcome obstacles and challenges that continue to arise in this journey.
