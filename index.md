Hey there! My name is John Rick Manzanares. I have been called John Rick, John Wick, John, Rick, and many others but I prefer the name 'John Rick'. I am a Filipino residing in <a href="https://philippines.travel/destinations/baguio-city"> Baguio City</a>, hailed as the Summer Capital of the Philippines and the City of Pines, located in the Central Cordillera of Northern Luzon. I finished high school at the <a href = "https://carc.pshs.edu.ph"> Philippine Science High School - Cordillera Administrative Region Campus</a>. Later on, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (2018) and Master of Science in Mathematics (2022) degrees at the <a href = "https://www.upb.edu.ph"> University of the Philippines (UP) Baguio</a>. Currently, I work as a Department of Science and Technology-Science Education Institute Career (CIP) Incentive Program Master of Science Graduate Fellow at the Quantification, Identification, Classification, and Mapping of Plastics Pollution (QuICMaPP) Facility.

## CIP GRADUATE FELLOW
~~~
<div align="justify">
As a dedicated CIP Fellow stationed at the QuICMaPP Facility, I have engaged in a diverse range of tasks and initiatives, leveraging my skills and expertise in the field. Here are some key highlights:
<ol>
  <li>
    Object Detection Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trained YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models using a comprehensive dataset consisting of field and laboratory-generated images featuring plastic waste. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Conducted hyperparameter tuning on the trained YOLOv5 model. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Performed five-fold cross validation to estimate the performance of the YOLO models on new data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provided a comparison between the YOLOv5, optimized YOLOv5, and YOLOv8 models and summarized training results in preparation of manuscript writing.  
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Class Activation Mapping (CAM) Analysis with YOLOv5
    <ul>
      <li>
        Applied Eigen-CAM to identify crucial regions of interest within the output of the YOLOv5 models and prepared a similar implementation on YOLOv8.
      </li>
      <li>
        Observed the CAM images to prepare a detailed analysis on the interpretations of the models.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Literature Review on Image Monitoring Tools
    <ul>
      <li>
        Contributed to a comprehensive literature review on image monitoring tools focused on macroplastic pollution.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assisted in identifying and evaluating open-source datasets relevant to the field.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Co-Supervision on Undergraduate Thesis
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provided comments on the methodology and the results to improve the quality of the study.
      </li>
      <li>
        Suggested improvements on the writing of a thesis project centered around model-assisted labeling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read advanced concepts on robust estimation and hypothesis testing.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Christmas Lantern Project
    <ul>
      <li>
        Successfully deployed the object detection model onto a compact Raspberry Pi device.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrated a light show into a plastic pollution-themed Christmas lantern, showcasing the versatility of the model in real-world applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Citizen Science Event
    <ul>
      <li>
        Investigated the feasibility of utilizing an annotated dataset from the public to develop a reliable plastic object detection model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed posters and signages for the conduct of the event catered to the UP Baguio community and an exclusive event for high school students outside UP Baguio.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
</ol>

## MATHEMATICAL JOURNEY
~~~
<div align="justify">
Throughout my studies, I consider differential geometry as the one area of interest that got away. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) caught my attention upon starting my master's thesis. 
<br><br>
Some of my friends, including <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>, and <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, helped me to overcome obstacles and challenges that continue to arise in this journey.
