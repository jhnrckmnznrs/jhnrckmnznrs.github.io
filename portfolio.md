## WEB SCRAPING
#### 22 AUGUST 2023

~~~

<div align="justify">
In this project, we scrape data from the beer section of the <a href = "https://www.boozy.ph">Boozy</a> website using the Beautiful Soup library in Python. Specifically, for each product in the said section, we extract the following:
<ul> <li> Name </li> <li> Price </li> <li> Star Rating </li> <li> Number of Reviews </li> </ul> 
</div>

<div align="justify">
A screenshot of the first page in the beer section of the website is shown below.

<div align="justify">
The program for data scraping is shown in the Python file named <a href = "/assets/scraper.py">scraper</a>. In this implementation, we construct a Pandas dataframe where names are stored as string, prices and ratings as floating point numbers, and number of reviews as integers. In the following figure, we see the first five observations. Prices are in Philippines pesos while ratings are on an integer scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.

As a web scraping project, we focused less on producing data mainly used for data analysis. However, we can provide some information about the products.

We start by considering the prices. The cheapest beer products priced at 60 pesos are the 330 mL bottled and the 330mL canned versions of Tiger Crystal. On the other hand, the most expensive beer product is the Stella Artois 330mL Bottle Bundle of 24 priced at 3576 pesos. Next, we consider the ratings. The five beer products with the highest number of reviews are shown in the following table. The number of reviews is also indicated in the table.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Reviews</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heineken 330mL 6-Pack</td>
    <td>99</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crazy Carabao Variety Pack #1</td>
    <td>42</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hoegaarden Rosee 750mL</td>
    <td>41</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>San Miguel Pale Pilsen 330mL Can 6-Pack</td>
    <td>33</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crazy Carabao IPA 330mL Bottle 6-Pack</td>
    <td>31</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div align="justify">
Now, we consider the star ratings. There are 77 products with a star rating of 5. We can filter this data further by including the number of reviews. The four highest-rated beer products with at least 5 reviews are presented in the following table, including their rating and number of reviews.

## A/B Testing (and Hypothesis Testing)
#### 28 August 2023 
~~~

<div align = "justify">
In this project, we conduct an A/B test using the <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergylog/ab-test-useraggregated-results">Kaggle</a> data. We will use common statistical procedures outlined in the <a href = "https://vkteam.medium.com/practitioners-guide-to-statistical-tests-ed2d580ef04f#1e3b">Medium</a> article by the VK Team. Moreover, we will implement the test in Python. 
<br><br>
First, we download the data saved in a CSV file and read the file using the pandas library. The data consists of the user ID, the number of views, the number of clicks, and the group where each user belongs from 80,000 users. Note that the values in the column associated to the user ID are distinct. Hence, we can drop the column from the dataframe.
<br><br>
Then, we inspect for missing values and inconsistent data types in each column. Using the info function from pandas, there are no null values present. The number of views and clicks are stored as 64-bit double-precision values, which expends memory storage. The minimum value for both columns is 0, while the maximum values are 21 and 206 for clicks and views, respectively. Hence, to free some memory, we convert each number of clicks as an 8-bit signed integer and each number of views as a 16-bit signed integer. We can also store each group label as a categorical data.
<br><br>
Now, we need to define a key metric to monitor for each group. We can compare the conversion rate defined by
</div>
~~~

$$C = \dfrac{\sum_{g \in G} c_g}{\sum_{g \in G} v_g}$$

where $G$ denotes the group (control or treatment), and $c_g$ is the number of clicks and $v_g$ is the number of views for user $g \in G$.

~~~
<div align = "justify">
We formulate a null and an alternative hypotheses for this statistical test. The null hypothesis states that "there is no significant difference between the groups" while the alternative hypothesis states otherwise.
