# 🌱 Banyuhay of John Rick Manzanares

Welcome to **Banyuhay of John Rick Manzanares**, my personal website.  
“Banyuhay” is a Filipino word meaning *metamorphosis* or *transformation* — a theme that reflects my academic journey, research work, and evolving interests in mathematics, computation, and the natural world.

This site serves as a digital space where I share my background, research, projects, and ongoing transformations as a mathematician and researcher.
