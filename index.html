            <div class="hero-description">
                <p>Change is the only constant and I have learned to embrace it.
                <br><br>
                I am John Rick Manzanares, though over the years, I have been called John Rick, John Wick, John, and Rick, but John Rick feels most like home. I am a Filipino from <a href="https://philippines.travelinations/baguio-city"> Baguio City</a>, the Summer Capital of the Philippines and the City of Pines nestled in the Central Cordillera of Northern Luzon. My academic journey began at the <a href = "https://carc.pshs.edu.ph"> Philippine Science High School - Cordillera Administrative Region Campus in Baguio City</a>. I went on to earn my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Mathematics at the <a href = "https://www.upb.edu.ph"> University of the Philippines Baguio</a>.
                <br><br>
                Mathematics has always been my lens for understanding change. I once thought differential geometry would define my future, but, like all transformations, my focus evolved. Through my mentor, <a href = "https://dmcsweb.upb.edu.ph/faculty/profile/7">Dr. Paul Samuel Ignacio</a>, I discovered the field of Topological Data Analysis that studies the shape of data and the “holes” that give it meaning. My master's thesis explored how persistent homology quantifies the importance of these holes — a poetic pursuit of structure within complexity.
                <br><br>
                My path has taken many forms, from developing a plastic object detection model at the Quantification, Identification, Classification, and Mapping of Plastics Pollution (QuICMaPP) Facility, to promoting citizen science and environmental awareness as a DOST-SEI Career Incentive Program Graduate Fellow under the UP Marine Science Institute.
                <br><br>
                Now, my journey continues in Europe. I am a Research Assistant at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, and a Doctoral Student of the International Environmental Doctoral School at the University of Silesia in Katowice. As a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Fellow for the <a href="https://www.gapmscaproject.com/">GAP Project</a>, I explore how mathematics and computation can illuminate the patterns of life by analyzing bone microstructures through computational geometry, applied topology, and machine learning.
                <br><br>
                Along the way, I have had steadfast companions: <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>, and <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, my loyal collaborators in solving problems, debugging challenges, and occasionally reminding me that even in mathematics, a missing parenthesis can change everything.

                    <h2>Strangers and Struggles in a New World</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h4>16 May 2025</h4>
                    <p>
                        A recent <a href="https://sulf.se/app/uploads/2025/04/Report-migration-SULF-dca_final_May7_25_updated.pdf">report</a> by the Swedish Association of University Teachers and Researchers echoes a reality I know all too well. As a PhD student and early-stage researcher in Poland, the quality of life issues raised in the study feel painfully familiar. What I once imagined as a calm and inspiring academic journey quickly unraveled into a bureaucratic labyrinth—and the nightmare began as early as the first week. The difficulty of securing the right to stay in Poland, particularly due to the scarcity of available appointment slots for a temporary residence permit, continues to be an uphill battle. Unlike EU citizens who navigate a more streamlined process, I am left with an inefficient, disheartening path that drags on endlessly. Strangely, it seems that only institutional connections with the immigration offices can unlock appointments—an implicit reflection on how systems sometimes reward proximity over fairness.
                        <br><br>
                        This prolonged instability has taken a toll on both my quality of life and mental health. Even after eight months, I find myself mentally fatigued, weighed down by the cumulative stress of opening a bank account, searching for a home, and navigating countless government offices for registration. Still, I am without a work laptop—so my personal one has unwillingly become my academic lifeline. Every day, I haul it back and forth, slowly erasing the line I once drew between work and personal life. I had envisioned this fellowship as a period of growth and ambition. Instead, I feel like a shadow of the researcher I set out to become—disillusioned, anxious, and lacking the mental space to even focus on developing my project. I often wonder: how can brilliance bloom in soil that is so dry and cracked?
                        <br><br>
                        The PhD journey, once a beacon of purpose, now feels like a cautionary tale. Ironically, when I assert my rights as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Fellow, as outlined clearly in the MSCA handbook—where host institutions are obligated to assist with administrative processes such as visa and residence permits—I am met with accusations of arrogance or disrespect. It is disheartening to be painted as problematic for simply requesting the support I was promised. I ask myself: what does it mean to uphold dignity in a system that often seems indifferent to it?
                        <br><br>
                        And so, here I am—navigating not only a research project but an entire infrastructure that feels unwelcoming. Each day may bring a new lesson in resilience. Our academic journeys deserve more than silent suffering. However, each day may also offer a new perspective on life. Perhaps the persistence of these unchanging academic challenges is not just a test of endurance, but a signal—reminding me that there are paths elsewhere, places that will truly value who I am and foster real growth, both personally and professionally.

                    <h4>26 February 2025</h4>
                    <p>
                        Moving to a new opportunity does not always mean stepping into a better environment. The struggles I face now feel eerily familiar—most of them have little to do with the research itself. Preparing for a presentation about my work should have been exciting, a chance to showcase my academic background, project objectives, and research plans. Instead, it only served as a reminder of the endless roadblocks. The lack of necessary data left me stranded, and project mismanagement only deepened the frustration. With every passing day, my motivation wanes, and the passion that once fueled my academic journey continues to slip away.
                        <br><br>
                        Then there are the logistical nightmares—visa applications, endless bureaucratic red tape, and the exhausting process of securing temporary residence as a foreign researcher. The lack of administrative support from my employer makes everything needlessly difficult. For months, anxiety has been creeping in as I navigate a system that seems designed to be as inefficient as possible. The foreigner department’s website is as bad as ever—confusing, outdated, and utterly unhelpful. Maybe this is a sign that it is time to rethink my path.
                        <br><br>
                        Attending scientific meetings, once something I looked forward to, has only reinforced my disillusionment. I expected intellectual engagement, thought-provoking discussions, and valuable insights to refine my work. Instead, I encountered dismissiveness, condescension, and outright disrespect. There was no constructive criticism—just gatekeeping disguised as expertise. This experience has made one thing clearer than ever: academia may not be worth it. The decision to leave is becoming less of a possibility and more of an inevitability.

                    <h4>20 December 2024</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first year of a PhD is a whirlwind of ideas and ambitions, where every choice shapes the trajectory of your academic journey. Writing a review paper often seems like an early milestone—a chance to showcase your grasp of the field while establishing yourself as a knowledgeable voice. Yet, for those engrossed in research, the time and effort required for a strong review can feel like a diversion from achieving tangible results.
                        <br><br>
                        A wise alternative is to prioritize the research itself. By weaving literature insights directly into the project, one can stay informed while maintaining focus on outcomes that matter. Tracking key publications and even preprints ensures you remain updated without the added pressure of formalizing findings into a standalone review. This approach channels your time into meaningful progress rather than dispersing efforts, avoiding premature proposals that might later prove challenging.
                        <br><br>
                        Every PhD journey is unique, and while a review paper might be a pivotal step for some, it is not a universal necessity. Whether you choose to dive into a review early or let it emerge naturally within your research, the goal remains the same: to contribute meaningfully to your field and community. Focus on what propels your work forward, and the rest will follow.

                    <p>
                        Moving to a new country is like diving headfirst into a novel where you are barely fluent in the language, and everyone else has already read the plot. Each day, I find myself stumbling through moments of awe and confusion. Even the simplest things &#8212; directions, food labels, conversations &#8212; feel like riddles waiting to be solved. My comfort zone has become a distant memory, replaced by a world where each small interaction is a test of patience and adaptability. One month down, with possibly three years and eleven months to go. Yet I still brace myself every time I venture out to tackle the mysteries of grocery aisles or government offices. Even routine tasks like opening a bank account took nearly three weeks, leaving me to wonder if the Institute had anticipated these bureaucratic adventures in my fellowship. I would not call it entitlement, but as an MSCA Fellow, I have a right to require support for all the administrative procedures that come with being an early-stage researcher in a foreign country.
                        <br><br>
                        Then there is the research program and doctoral school &#8212; an entirely different kind of adventure. Long hours of data extraction, thanks to the computational complexity of implemented algorithm, have left me bleary-eyed. I have had a few presentations in this first month, each a fresh reminder of my own nerves and the gnawing doubt about whether I truly understand my own research. The language barrier adds yet another layer. Asking for technical help or sharing ideas with peers requires careful phrasing and humility. I second-guess my words, wondering if I have managed to communicate my thoughts clearly or if something essential has slipped through the cracks. It is a strange feeling, standing before an audience and realizing that while I am trying to bridge a language gap, I am also trying not to trip over my own words. Somehow, I will either find resilience in all this fumbling or surrender and go back to where I came from.
                        <br><br>
                        Each day, I find myself juggling between moments of optimism &#8212; trusting that I will eventually feel at home &#8212; and flashes of pessimism, wondering if I will always feel like a stranger. Let us see where this journey takes me, and decide by then whether there is still a reason, or even a glimmer of hope, to keep pursuing this doctorate degree.
