My name is John Rick Manzanares. I have been called John Rick, John Wick, John, Rick, and many others but I prefer the name 'John Rick'. I am a Filipino residing in <a href="https://philippines.travel/destinations/baguio-city"> Baguio City</a>, hailed as the Summer Capital of the Philippines and the City of Pines, located in the Central Cordillera of Northern Luzon. I finished high school at the <a href = "https://carc.pshs.edu.ph"> Philippine Science High School - Cordillera Administrative Region Campus</a>. Later on, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics (2018) and Master of Science in Mathematics (2022) degrees at the <a href = "https://www.upb.edu.ph"> University of the Philippines (UP) Baguio</a>. Currently, I work as a Department of Science and Technology-Science Education Institute Career (CIP) Incentive Program Master of Science Graduate Fellow at the Quantification, Identification, Classification, and Mapping of Plastics Pollution (QuICMaPP) Facility. </div> <h2 id=cip_graduate_fellow ><a href="#cip_graduate_fellow" class=header-anchor >CIP GRADUATE FELLOW</a></h2> <div align=justify > As a dedicated CIP Fellow stationed at the QuICMaPP Facility, I have engaged in a diverse range of tasks and initiatives, leveraging my skills and expertise in the field. Here are some key highlights: <ol> <li> Object Detection Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning <ul> <li> Trained YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models using a comprehensive dataset consisting of field and laboratory-generated images featuring plastic waste. <li> Conducted hyperparameter tuning on the trained YOLOv5 model. <li> Performed five-fold cross validation to estimate the performance of the YOLO models on new data. <li> Provided a comparison between the YOLOv5, optimized YOLOv5, and YOLOv8 models and summarized training results in preparation of manuscript writing. </ul> <li> Class Activation Mapping (CAM) Analysis with YOLOv5 <ul> <li> Applied Eigen-CAM to identify crucial regions of interest within the output of the YOLOv5 models and prepared a similar implementation on YOLOv8. <li> Observed the CAM images to prepare a detailed analysis on the interpretations of the models. </ul> <li> Literature Review on Image Monitoring Tools <ul> <li> Contributed to a comprehensive literature review on image monitoring tools focused on macroplastic pollution. <li> Assisted in identifying and evaluating open-source datasets relevant to the field. </ul> <li> Co-Supervision on Undergraduate Thesis <ul> <li> Provided comments on the methodology and the results to improve the quality of the study. <li> Suggested improvements on the writing of a thesis project centered around model-assisted labeling. <li> Read advanced concepts on robust estimation and hypothesis testing. </ul> <li> Christmas Lantern Project <ul> <li> Successfully deployed the object detection model onto a compact Raspberry Pi device. <li> Integrated a light show into a plastic pollution-themed Christmas lantern, showcasing the versatility of the model in real-world applications. </ul> <li> Citizen Science Event <ul> <li> Investigated the feasibility of utilizing an annotated dataset from the public to develop a reliable plastic object detection model. <li> Designed posters and signages for the conduct of the event catered to the UP Baguio community and an exclusive event for high school students outside UP Baguio. </ul> </ol> </div> <h2 id=mathematical_journey ><a href="#mathematical_journey" class=header-anchor >MATHEMATICAL JOURNEY</a></h2> <div align=justify > Throughout my studies, I consider differential geometry as the one area of interest that got away. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) caught my attention upon starting my master's thesis. <br><br> Some of my friends, including <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a>, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>, and <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a>, helped me to overcome obstacles and challenges that continue to arise in this journey. </div> <h2 id=get_in_touch ><a href="#get_in_touch" class=header-anchor >GET IN TOUCH</a></h2> <div align=justify > Feel free to connect with me by sending a message to my <a href="mailto:jdmanzanares@up.edu.ph">email address</a>.
