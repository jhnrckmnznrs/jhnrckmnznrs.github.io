# CIP GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP
~~~
<div align="justify">
Embarking my journey as a CIP Fellow stationed at the QuICMaPP Facility, I have actively participated in a diverse range of tasks and initiatives, leveraging my skills and expertise in the field. Here are some key highlights:
<ol>
  <li>
    Object Detection Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trained YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models using a comprehensive dataset consisting of field and laboratory-generated images featuring plastic waste. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Conducted hyperparameter tuning on the trained YOLOv5 model. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Performed five-fold cross validation to estimate the performance of the YOLO models on new data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provided a comparison between the YOLOv5, optimized YOLOv5, and YOLOv8 models and summarized training results in preparation of manuscript writing.  
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Class Activation Mapping (CAM) Analysis with YOLOv5
    <ul>
      <li>
        Applied Eigen-CAM to identify crucial regions of interest within the output of the YOLOv5 models and prepared a similar implementation on YOLOv8.
      </li>
      <li>
        Observed the CAM images to prepare a detailed analysis on the interpretations of the models.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Performance Evaluation of the Model
    <ul>
      <li>
        Summarized the performance metrics and created visualizations to comopare the YOLOv5 (Default and Optimized) models and the YOLOv8 model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provided a short discussion of the history of YOLO, hyperparameter evolution, and object detection metrics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Used hypothesis testing to determine whether the models are significantly difference from each other.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Literature Review on Image Monitoring Tools
    <ul>
      <li>
        Contributed to a comprehensive literature review on image monitoring tools focused on macroplastic pollution.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assisted in identifying and evaluating open-source datasets relevant to the field.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Co-Supervision on Undergraduate Thesis
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provided comments on the methodology and the results to improve the quality of the study.
      </li>
      <li>
        Suggested improvements on the writing of a thesis project centered around model-assisted labeling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read advanced concepts on robust estimation and hypothesis testing.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Christmas Lantern Project
    <ul>
      <li>
        Successfully deployed the object detection model onto a compact Raspberry Pi device.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrated a light show into a plastic pollution-themed Christmas lantern, showcasing the versatility of the model in real-world applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Citizen Science Event
    <ul>
      <li>
        Investigated the feasibility of utilizing an annotated dataset from the public to develop a reliable plastic object detection model.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designed posters and signages for the conduct of the event catered to the UP Baguio community and an exclusive event for high school students outside UP Baguio.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
</ol>
These accomplishments reflect my commitment to advancing knowledge and applying cutting-edge technologies in meaningful and creative ways. I am excited to continue contributing to innovative projects and driving positive change in my field.
